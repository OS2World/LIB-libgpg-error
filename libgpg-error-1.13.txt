        Long Description: libgpg-error v1.13
This is a library that defines common error values for all GnuPG
components.  Among these are GPG, GPGSM, GPGME, GPG-Agent, libgcrypt,
Libksba, DirMngr, Pinentry, SmartCard Daemon and more.

v1.10-r2 : Fixed the problem that gpg-error.dll cannot be loaded because
           it has longer name than 8 characters. Now it is truncated to
           gpg-erro.dll. Reported by Elbert Pol.
